if all the sets are classified up to unique groups, the Entrophy value is 0

consider one feture

information grain - upper level entropy - lower level entropy

fix classses depend on the maximum information gain
    -1st decision made

then consider next feature

root node - 1st node

leaf node - final sorted out notes (entrophy = 0)

information gain - decrease in entrophy
